# Project 1 - Asking and Answering a Research Question

This project is designed to help you become acquainted with data analysis, and will require elements of each of the first four lectures and labs to complete. 
You must submit all of the code (SQL queries) that you use during the process of completing this project. 
Aside from any visuals or code you submit, the writeup should be approximately 2-3 pages long.

1) **(After Completing Topic 1)** Using the football data provided, begin by exploring the data in Tableau.
    - What aspect(s) of the data do you and your team find most interesting?
    - Based on what your team finds interesting, come up with a research question that you would like to address using the available data.
    - How will you go about testing that hypothesis?
    - What variables will you need?
        - Will you need to aggregate data at the play level? The team level? The season level?
    - Write a 1-2 paragraph proposal of what you plan to do in your research project.
    - Publish your favorite visuals to Tableau Online!

    
2) **(After Completing Topic 2)** Using SQL queries, isolate the data your team needs in order to test the hypothesis you developed in Step 1. 
    - It is okay if you decide to reformulate your research question as you learn more about the data set. Be sure to document this in your writeup.
    - Make sure to select at approximately 10 variables for use in this project (if you aren't sure what to include, reach out on Slack and I can help you think about useful variables)
        - Include a description of the variables you collected in your dataset and why you choose to use them in your writeup.

3) **(After Completing Topic 3)** Explore your newly crafted data set using Tableau. 
    - Answer the following in your writeup:
        - Do you see any outliers or unanticipated values in your data? 
        - Do you think you should restrict your sample further to eliminate outliers?
        - Why is it so important to look at our data before beginning to test our hypothesis?
    - Based on your data from last class, create two or more visualizations of your data that could be used to inform decision-making with respect to your hypothesis. 
        - In your writeup, explain why you chose those visuals, and what they suggest about your population (or events) of interest.
        - What are the advantages of using data visualization to make decisions?
        - Are there any disadvantages?
        - How do you think that we can best use data visualizations in decision-making?
    - Publish your work to Tableau Online.


4) **(After Completing Topic 4)** Continuing to use the data you selected in Week 2, run two separate linear regressions in order to evaluate the impact of at least three parameters on your outcome of interest (dependent variable). 
    - If this is not feasible, determine how you can modify your data to perform the desired regressions, and then modify your data accordingly before attempting the regressions. 
    - Remember that it is generally a bad idea to use a discrete variable as the dependent variable in regression analysis.
    - In your writeup, answer the following:
        - What do your regressions tell you about the population?
        - Do you have any reason to believe that there is a causal relationship between your parameters and outcomes?
        - What makes regression analysis so powerful?
