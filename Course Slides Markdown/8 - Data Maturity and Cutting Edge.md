# Data Maturity and Cutting Edge Models

---

# Open-source - why?

![bg right](opensource.jpg)

What makes a good predictive model?
- Good code
- **Helpful data**

Firms share their code, while protecting their data

# Neural Networks

![bg right 90%](marIO.jpg)

- Designed to simulate the way that neurons in our brains work

# Neural Networks

![bg right 90%](mariFlow.jpg)

- Allows for very abstract problems to be represented and solved

# How does it work?

![bg left 100%](neuron.png)

- Inputs are combined into a single value
- If the value is high enough, the neuron "activates" and sends a signal forward

# Build one!

# Data Maturity Model

---

# Operational

![bg left 100%](stage1.gif)

Analytics are only done where they are REQUIRED, and are not used to coordinate or improve processes

---

# Descriptive

![bg right 100%](stage2.gif)

BI is used to report, but not used uniformly or consistently

---

# Planning

![bg left 100%](stage3.gif)

Analytics are now used consistently, and to coordinate planning across the organization

---

# Predictive

![bg right 100%](stage4.gif)

The organization moves beyond using data to plan, and begins using it to inform future decisions by predicting outcomes

---

# Prescriptive

![bg left 100%](stage5.jpg)

Data are used to FIND problems, in addition to planning and predicting based on known problems

---

# Where is your organization?

# For lab

Finish your second project!

Thanks for a fun semester!
